## Why I Started NexaFeed

Hey, glad you're here! Let me tell you a bit about why I felt the need to build NexaFeed.

### The Struggle Is Real
You know how it goes, right? We're living in an information-rich era, but finding a single platform that bundles everything up just the way you want it is a real challenge. I was on the same boat, struggling to keep up with things like the latest security breaches, privacy news, and much more.

### Unlimited Access
So, the first thing I wanted was more than what platforms like Feedly could offer. Those 100 RSS feed caps for the free plan weren't cutting it for me. I needed a platform that could grow as my interests and needs did.

### YouTube, Anytime, Anywhere
Switching platforms to stay updated with YouTube was a hassle. I wanted that integrated right into NexaFeed.

### Any Device, Any Time
One of the best things about NexaFeed being a web app is that you can use it on any device that has a web browser. Your content will always be within reach.

## Introduction

NexaFeed is a web-based RSS feed aggregator that allows you to stay updated with your favorite websites, all in one place. Built with Quart, Jinja2, Bootstrap, and Alpine.js, it offers a clean UI and various features to enhance your feed reading experience.
